     <p><span class="first-sentence">In a different time, in a different place</span><br></p>
      <p>There was a small boy in a boat, traveling down a river catching fish from the side when he came upon two figures walking up on the banks of the river.<br>
      As he came close enough to make them out more clearly, he discovered that one of them was a tall man and the other was a beautiful woman. <br></p>
      <p>"Hello," said the man <br></p>
      <p>"Hello," said the woman <br></p>
      <p>"Hello," said the boy <br></p>
      <p>"My name is Death," said the man, "and this my friend. Her name is Love." <br> "It is a pleasure to meet you," said the boy <br>"Won't you come and walk with us today?" asked Love, "For in this forest there are many beautiful and wonderful things we can show you." <br></p>
      <p>"Ah," said the boy, "it is <em>a kind invitation.</em> But I'm afraid if I was to leave this boat and come walk with you, I would miss all the fish that are yet to be caught in this river, and what greater joy is there to a boy than to pull a fish from the river?"</p> 
      <p>And he continued on his way.</p>

     <p><span class="first-sentence"> Many years later </span></p>
     <p>When the boy had grown to a man, he was walking through the forest carrying his tools for work.<br> He came upon Death and Love walking in the opposite direction<br></p>
     <p>"Hello," said the man <br></p>
     <p>"Hello," said Death<br></p>
     <p>"Hello," said Love. <br></p>
     <p>"Won't you come and walk with us," asked Love, "for it has been many years since we first met, <br> and even on this road you walk every day of your life, there are many beautiful and wonderful things we can show you."<br></p>
     <p>"Ah," said the man, "it is a kind invitation, but I'm not as na√Øve as I was when we first met. <br> I know now that if I was to walk with you, and turn to speak with love, I will have left my back towards Death, <br> and his dangers have become famous to me. If I was to turn and speak with Death, I will have left my back to Love, <br> and even the most beautiful flower in the forest will look broken and decayed." <br></p>
     <p>"Besides," said the man, "I have much work to do."<br> And he continued on his way.</p>

     <p><span class="first-sentence"> Many years later </span></p>
      <p> When the man had grown old, and his beard was long and white, and his face looked like a map of the mountains, <br> Death came to visit him <br></p>
      <p>"Hello," said the man <br></p>
      <p>"Hello," said Death <br></p>
      <p>"All of these years I have looked to find her alone," said the man,<br> "but when I came near, I found you were there also." <br> </p>
      <p>"Ah," said Death, sitting down beside the man, "that was your mistake.<br> For wherever Love is, I am close behind. <br>She displays my power and my poetry and even my beauty. <br> When I am nearby, Love's face shines brighter, the colors of the earth burn truer, and time itself speeds." <br></p>
      <p>"I have always avoided her to be clear of you," said the man <br>"Then I too have made a mistake," said Death, rising to his feet,</p>
      <p>"by never telling you that I always come alone in the end."</p>
